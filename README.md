2. Right-click the shortcut and select **Properties**
3. In the **Target** field, add `explorer` before the path:

5. Right-click the shortcut and select **Pin to taskbar**
6. After pinning, right-click the taskbar icon ‚Üí **Properties** to change the icon back to your preferred icon

**Example:** `explorer C:\iTunes.VBS`

**Note:** You'll need to reapply the custom icon after adding the `explorer` prefix, as Windows may reset it.

CREATIVE_CATEGORIES = {
    "AUDIO": {
        "folder_path": "I:\\Audio",  # Change to your audio base path
        # ...
    },
    # ...
}
```

### Adding Custom Scripts

1. Create your script in the `modules/` directory
2. Follow the naming convention: `PipelineScript_Category_Name.py`
3. Add the script reference in `floriandheer_pipeline.py` under the appropriate category

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Module not found" errors**
- Solution: Run `python install_dependencies.py` to install missing dependencies

**Issue: pyexiv2 installation fails**
- Solution: pyexiv2 requires system libraries. On Linux: `sudo apt-get install libexiv2-dev`
- On Windows: Download pre-built wheels from PyPI

**Issue: Scripts don't launch**
- Solution: Verify script paths in the main configuration match your system
- Check that base folder paths exist or script can create them
